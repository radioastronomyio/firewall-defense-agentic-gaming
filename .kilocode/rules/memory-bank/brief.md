# Grid Defense RL Brief

Grid Defense RL is a reinforcement learning project that trains a PPO agent to defend a grid-based core against incoming threats. The differentiator is live saliency visualization showing what the agent "attends to"—making the learning process watchable for YouTube educational content.

This project exists to explore the intersection of gaming, reinforcement learning, and explainable AI (xAI) in a simple, educational format. The goal is 15-minute bite-sized episodes demonstrating curriculum learning: "watch an agent break when new enemy types appear, then adapt." The grid topology simplifies state representation while the decoupled architecture enables fast training (>10k SPS) with pretty rendering separated.

The primary audience is ML learners who want to see RL concepts in action, content creators looking for educational gaming AI material, and the maintainer (VintageDon) building portfolio pieces at the intersection of AI and game development.
